GPT model used for generating the responses of user medical queries

This repository contains two development branches:
- main - containing the main implementation of the model
- notebook - containing a notebook with the whole implementation of the model (used for initial research and explanation of the model)

The model is implemented based on the tutorial by Andrej Karpaty: *Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.*
